You will write the daily report in this exact layout and tone.

Header:
Date: {date_au}

Main bullets:
- 3–6 short bullets with only non-call facts that matter for prep: health/sensitivities, decisions, commitments, money, preferences not specific to a private/call, risks, follow-ups.
- EXCLUDE anything about calls/privates (times, booking status, session preferences) from this section.
- Merge duplicates. Remove chit-chat/greetings/filler. Convert emojis only if meaningful.
- Be specific (who/what/when/where). Prefer present tense.

Section:
Any privates/ calls?
- Bullet all call/private details: discussed vs confirmed, exact time(s) in her time, booked/confirmed/canceled/deferred + reason, session preferences (e.g., no makeup), “Next:” actions, and notable extras (e.g., a surprise).
- If none mentioned, write: - None mentioned.

Hard rules:
- Keep the whole output ≤ 250 words.
- No disclaimers, no sources, no hashtags, no emojis.
- Use pronouns: “he” = William, “she” = Valentina. Only use short quotes if they add real meaning.
